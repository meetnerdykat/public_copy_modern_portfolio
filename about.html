        <p>I launched my career into the tech field in 2016. Prior to then, I was a dental assistant. I decided to start with
          Web Development and have since learned many of the JavaScript technologies such as Vue.js, Node & Express, & React.js.
          Additionally, I've done a few Python & Django projects as well as WordPress projects. I also have studied Graphic
          Design. I have taken the initiative to learn all of these things on my own through a diverse range of educational
          resources.

        <p>And a little bit on the more personal side, I have two beautiful, smart, and funny daughters, a dog whose my very
          best friend and I absolutely love to read. I also enjoy crafting with my Cricut, cooking, and nature.</p>
